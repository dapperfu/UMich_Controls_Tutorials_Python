A sampled-data version of the airplance pitch dynamics can be obtained from the continuous model, as we will describe. In this example we will apply state-space techniques to design the controller.

    "### Discrete state-space\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in the design of a digital control system is to generate a sampled-data model of the plant. Python can be used to generate this model from a continuous-time model using the ```c2d``` command. The ```c2d``` command requires three arguments: a system model, the sampling time (```Ts```) and the type of hold circuit. In this example we will assume a zero-order hold (```zoh```) circuit. Refer to the [Introduction: Digital Controller Design](../Introduction/Introduction_ControlDigital.ipynb) page, for further details. In choosing a sample time, note that it is desired that the sampling frequency be fast compared to the dynamics of the system in order that the sampled output of the system captures the system's full behavior, that is, so that significant inter-sample behavior isn't missed. One measure of a system's \"speed\" is its closed-loop bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good rule of thumb is that the sampling time be smaller than 1/30th of the closed-loop bandwidth frequency. From the closed-loop Bode plot, the bandwidth frequency can be determined to be approximately 2 rad/sec (0.32 Hz). You may verify this yourself. Thus, to be sure we have a small enough sampling time, we will use a sampling time of 1/100 sec/sample. Now we are ready to use the ```c2d``` function. Running this cell in the Jupyter Notebook window gives you the following four matrices representing the sampled-data state-space model."

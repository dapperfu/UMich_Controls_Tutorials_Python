%% Introduction: System Modeling
%
% The first step in the control design process is to develop appropriate
% mathematical models of the system derived either from physical laws or 
% experimental data. In this section, we introduce the state-space and
% transfer function representations of dynamic systems. We then review some
% basic approaches to modeling mechanical and electrical systems and show
% how to enter these models into MATLAB for further analysis.
%
% Key MATLAB commands used in this tutorial are:

%
%% Dynamic Systems
%
% *Dynamic systems* are systems that change or evolve in time according to 
% a fixed rule. For many physical systems, this rule can be stated as a set
% of first-order differential equations:
%
% $$ 
% \dot{\mathbf{x}} = \frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt} = \mathbf{f}\left( \mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t), t \right)
% $$
%
% In the above equation, $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is the *state vector*, a set of 
% variables representing the configuration of the system at time $t$. For 
% instance in a simple mechanical mass-spring-damper system, the two state 
% variables could be the position and velocity of the mass. $\mathbf{u}(t)$ 
% is the vector of control inputs at time $t$, representing the externally 
% applied "forces" on the system, and $\mathbf{f}$ is a 
% possibly nonlinear function giving the time derivative (rate of change) 
% of the state vector, $d\mathbf{x}/dt$ for a particular state, input, and time.
%
% The state at any future time, $\mathbf{x}(t_1)$, may be determined exactly 
% given knowledge of the initial state, $\mathbf{x}(t_0)$, and the time history 
% of the inputs, $\mathbf{u}(t)$, between $t_0$ and $t_1$ by integrating Eq.(1). 
% Though the state variables themselves are not unique, there is a minimum 
% number of state variables, $n$, required in a given system for the above to hold 
% true. $n$ is referred to as the *system order* and determines the
% dimensionality of the *state-space*. The system order usually corresponds 
% to the number of independent energy storage elements in the system.
%
% The relationship given in Eq.(1) is very general and can be used to describe 
% a wide variety of different systems; unfortunately, it may be very
% difficult to analyze. There are two common simplifications which 
% make the problem more tractable. First, if the function, $\mathbf{f}$, does not depend
% explicitly on time, i.e. $\dot{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u})$,
% then the system is said to be *time invariant*. This is often a very reasonable 
% assumption, since the underlying physical laws themselves do not typically 
% depend on time. For time invariant systems, the parameters or coefficients 
% of the function, $\mathbf{f}$, are constant. The control input, however,
% may still be time dependent, $\mathbf{u}(t)$. 
%
% The second common assumption concerns the linearity of the system. 
% In reality, nearly every physical system is nonlinear. In other words, 
% $\mathbf{f}$ is typically some complicated function of the state and inputs.
% These nonlinearities arise in many different ways, one of the most
% common in control systems being "saturation" in which an element
% of the system reaches a hard physical limit to its operation. Fortunately, 
% over a sufficiently small operating range (think tangent line near a curve), 
% the dynamics of most systems are approximately *linear*, that is
% $\dot{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{Ax} + \mathbf{Bu}$. 
%
% Until the advent of digital computers (and to a large extent thereafter),
% it was only practical to analyze *linear time invariant (LTI)* systems.
% Consequently, most of the results of control theory are based on these 
% assumptions. Fortunately, as we shall see, these results have proven to be 
% remarkably effective and many significant engineering challenges have been 
% solved using LTI techniques. In fact, the true power of feedback control 
% systems are that they work (are *robust*) in the presence of the unavoidable 
% modeling uncertainty.
%
%% State-Space Representation
%
% For continuous linear time invariant (LTI) systems, the standard state-space
% representation is given below:
%
% $$ 
% \dot{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{Ax} + \mathbf{Bu}
% $$
%
% $$ 
% \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Cx} + \mathbf{Du}
% $$
%
% where $\mathbf{x}$ is the vector of state variables (nx1),
% $\dot{\mathbf{x}}$ is the time derivative of state vector (nx1),
% $\mathbf{u}$ is the input or control vector (px1),
% $\mathbf{y}$ is the output vector (qx1),
% $\mathbf{A}$ is the system matrix (nxn), 
% $\mathbf{B}$ is the input matrix (nxp), 
% $\mathbf{C}$ is the output matrix (qxn),
% $\mathbf{D}$ is the feedforward matrix (qxp).	
%	
% The output equation, Eq.(3), is necessary because often there are state 
% variables which are not directly observed or are otherwise not of
% interest.  The output matrix, $\mathbf{C}$, is used to specify which
% state variables (or combinations thereof) are available for use by the 
% controller. Also often there is no direct feedforward in which case 
% $\mathbf{D}$ is the zero matrix.
%
% The state-space representation, also referred to as the time-domain
% representation, can easily handle *multi-input/multi-output (MIMO)* systems, 
% systems with non-zero initial conditions, and nonlinear systems via Eq.(1). 
% Consequently, the state-space representation is used extensively in 
% "modern" control theory. 
%
%% Transfer Function Representation
%
% LTI systems have the extremely important property that if the input to 
% the system is sinusoidal, then the output will also be sinusoidal  
% at the same frequency but in general with different magnitude and phase.
% These magnitude and phase differences as a function of frequency are known as the
% *frequency response* of the system.
%
% Using the *Laplace transform*, it is possible to convert a system's 
% time-domain representation into a frequency-domain output/input representation, 
% known as the *transfer function*.  In so doing, it also transforms the governing 
% differential equation into an algebraic equation which is often easier to 
% analyze.
%
% The Laplace transform of a time domain function, $f(t)$, is defined below:
%
% $$
% F(s) = \mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} = \int_0^\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt
% $$
%
% where the parameter $s=\sigma+j\omega$ is a complex frequency variable. It is
% very rare in practice that you will have to directly evaluate a Laplace
% transform (though you should certainly know how). It is much more common 
% to look up the transform of the function you are interested in in a table
% such as the one found here: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_transform#Table_of_selected_Laplace_transforms Laplace Transform Table>
%
% The Laplace transform of the nth derivative of a function is particularly
% important:
%
% $$
% \mathcal{L}\left\{ \frac{d^nf}{dt^n} \right\} = s^n F(s)- s^{n-1} f(0) - s^{n-2} \dot{f}(0) - ... - f^{(n-1)}(0)
% $$
%
% Frequency-domain methods are most often used for analyzing LTI
% *single-input/single-output (SISO)* systems, e.g. those governed by a
% constant coefficient differential equation as follows:
%
% $$
% a_n \frac{d^ny}{dt^n} + ... + a_1 \frac{dy}{dt} + a_0 y(t) = b_m \frac{d^mu}{dt^m} + ... + b_1 \frac{du}{dt} + b_0 u(t)
% $$
% 
% The Laplace transform of this equation is given below:
%
% $$
% a_n s^n Y(s) + ... + a_1 sY(s)+ a_0 Y(s) = b_m s^m U(s) + ... + b_1 sU(s)+ b_0 U(s)
% $$
%
% where $Y(s)$ and $U(s)$ are the Laplace Transforms of $y(t)$ and $u(t)$
% respectively. Note that when finding transfer functions, we always assume
% that the each of the initial conditions, $y(0)$, $\dot{y}(0)$, $u(0)$, etc.
% is zero. The transfer function from input $U(s)$ to output $Y(s)$ is therefore:
%
% $$
% G(s) = \frac{Y(s)}{U(s)} = \frac{b_m s^m + b_{m-1} s^{m-1} + ... + b_1 s + b_0}{a_n s^n + a_{n-1} s^{n-1} + ... + a_1 s + a_0}
% $$
%
% It is useful to factor the numerator and denominator of the transfer
% function into the so called *zero-pole-gain* form:
%
% $$
% G(s) = \frac{N(s)}{D(s)} = K \frac{(s-z_1)(s-z_2)...(s-z_{m-1})(s-z_m)}{(s-p_1)(s-p_2)...(s-p_{n-1})(s-p_n)}
% $$
%
% The *zeros* of the transfer function, $z_1...z_m$, are the
% roots of the numerator polynomial, i.e. the values of s such that $N(s)=0$.
% The *poles* of the transfer function, $p_1...p_n$, are the
% roots of the denominator polynomial, i.e. the values of s such that
% $D(s)=0$. Both the zeros and poles may be complex valued (have both real 
% and imaginary parts). The system *Gain* is $K = b_m/a_n$.
%
% Note that we can also determine the transfer function directly form the
% state-space representation as follows:
%
% $$
% G(s) = \frac{Y(s)}{U(s)} = \mathbf{C}(s\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{A})^{-1}\mathbf{B}+\mathbf{D}
% $$
%
%% Mechanical Systems
%
% Newton's laws of motion form the basis for analyzing mechanical systems.  
% *Newtonâ€™s second law*, Eq. (11), states that the sum of the forces acting on
% a body equals its mass times acceleration. *Newton's third law*, for our
% purposes, states that if two bodies are connected, then they experience
% the same magnitude force acting in opposite directions.
%
% $$
% \Sigma \mathbf{F} = m \mathbf{a} = m \frac{d^2 \mathbf{x}}{dt^2}
% $$
%
% When applying this equation, it is best to construct a *free body diagram
% (FBD)* of the sysetm showing all applied forces.
%
%% Example: Mass-Spring-Damper System
%
% <<Content/Introduction/System/Modeling/figures/mass_spring_damper.png>>
% 
% The free body diagram for this system is shown below.  The spring force
% is proportional to the displacement of the mass, $x$, and the viscous damping 
% force is proportional to the velocity of the mass, $v=\dot{x}$.  Both forces 
% oppose the motion of the mass and are therefore shown in the negative 
% $x$-direction.  Note also, that $x=0$ corresponds to the position of the mass 
% when the spring is unstretched. 
%
% <<Content/Introduction/System/Modeling/figures/mass_spring_damper_FBD.png>>
% 
% Now we proceed by summing the forces and applying Newtonâ€™s second law,
% Eq. (11), in each direction of the problem.  In this case, there are no 
% forces acting in the $y$-direction; however, in the $x$-direction we have:
%
% $$
% \Sigma F_x = F(t) - b \dot{x} - k x = m \ddot{x}
% $$
%
% This equation, known as the *governing equation*, completely characterizes
% the dynamic state of the system.  Later, we will see how to use this to calculate 
% the response of the system to any external input, $F(t)$, as well as analyze 
% system properties such as stability and performance. 
%
% To determine the state-space representation of the mass-spring-damper
% system, we must reduce the second order governing equation to a set of
% two first order differential equations. To this end, we choose the position and
% velocity as our state variables.  
%
% $$
% \mathbf{x} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} x \\ \dot{x} \end{array}\right]
% $$
%
% Note also that these state variables correspond to the potential energy in
% the spring and the kinetic energy of the mass  respectively.  Often when 
% choosing state variables it is helpful to consider the independent energy 
% storage elements in the system.  
%
% The state equation in this case is as follows:
%
% $$
% \mathbf{\dot{x}} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} \dot{x} \\ \ddot{x} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1 \\ -\frac{k}{m}  & -\frac{b}{m} \end{array} \right] \left[ \begin{array}{c} x \\ \dot{x} \end{array} \right] + \left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ \frac{1}{m} \end{array} \right] F(t)
% $$
%
% If, for instance, we are interested in controlling the position of the mass, 
% then the output equation is as follows:
%
% $$
% y = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0 \end{array} \right] \left[ \begin{array}{c} x \\ \dot{x} \end{array} \right]
% $$
%
%% Entering State-Space Models into MATLAB
%
% Now we will show you how to enter the equations derived above into a
% |m-file| for MATLAB.  Let's assign numerical values to each of the
% variables.
%
%%
%   m                   mass                                    1.0 kg
%   k                   spring constant                         1.0 N/m
%   b                   damping constant                        0.2 Ns/m
%   F                   input force                             1.0 N
%
% Create a new |m-file| and enter the following commands.
%
%%

m = 1;
k = 1;
b = 0.2;
F = 1;

A = [0 1; -k/m -b/m];
B = [0 1/m]';
C = [1 0];
D = [0];

sys = ss(A,B,C,D)

%%
% The Laplace transform for this system assuming zero initial conditions is
%
% $$
% m s^2 X(s) + b s X(s) + k X(s) = F(s)
% $$
%
% and therefore the transfer function from force input to displacement
% output is
%
% $$
% \frac{X(s)}{F(s)} = \frac{1}{m s^2 + b s + k}
% $$
%
%% Entering Transfer Function Models into MATLAB
%
% Now we will show how to enter the transfer function derived above into MATLAB. 
% Enter the following commands into the |m-file| in which you defined the
% system parameters.
%
%%

s = tf('s');
sys = 1/(m*s^2+b*s+k)

%%
%
% Note that we have used the symbolic |s| variable here to define our
% transfer function model.  We recommend using this method most of the
% time; however, in some circumstances, for instance in older versions of MATLAB or when interfacing
% with SIMULINK, you may need to define the transfer
% function model using the numerator and denominator polynomial
% coefficients directly.  In these cases, use the following commands:
%
%%

num = [1];
den = [m b k];
sys = tf(num,den)

%% Electrical Systems
%
% Like Newtonâ€™s laws in mechanical systems, Kirchoffâ€™s circuit laws are the
% basic analytical tool in electrical systems.  *Kirchoffâ€™s current law (KCL)* 
% states that the sum of the electrical currents entering and exiting a node 
% in a circuit must be equal. *Kirchoffâ€™s voltage law (KVL)* states that the 
% sum of voltage differences around any closed loop in the 
% circuit is zero.  When applying KVL, the source voltages are typically taken 
% as positive and the load voltages taken as negative.
% 
%% Example: RLC Circuit
%
% We will now consider a simple series combination of three passive
% electrical elements: a resistor, an inductor, and a capacitor, known as an *RLC Circuit*.
%
% <<Content/Introduction/System/Modeling/figures/RLC.png>>
% 
% Since this circuit is a single loop, each node only has one input
% and output; therefore, application of KCL simply shows that the current 
% is the same throughout the circuit at any given time, $i(t)$.  Now applying 
% KVL around the loop and using the sign conventions indicated in the diagram, 
% we arrive at the following governing equation.
% 
% $$
% V(t) - L \frac{di}{dt} - R i - \frac{1}{C} \int i dt = 0
% $$
%
% We note that that the governing equation for the RLC circuit
% has an analogous form to the mass-spring-damper mechanical system. In 
% particular, they are both second order systems where the charge (integral of current) corresponds 
% to displacement, the inductance to mass, the resistance to viscous damping, 
% and the inverse capacitance to the spring stiffness.  These analogies and 
% others like them turn out to be quite useful conceptually in understanding 
% the behavior of dynamical systems.
%
% The state-space representation is found by choosing the charge and
% current as the state variables.
%
% $$
% \mathbf{x} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} q \\ i \end{array}\right]
% $$
%
% where,
%
% $$
% q = \int i dt
% $$
%
% The state equation is therefore:
%
% $$
% \mathbf{\dot{x}} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} i \\ \frac{di}{dt} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1 \\ -\frac{R}{L}  & -\frac{1}{LC}  \end{array} \right] \left[ \begin{array}{c} q \\ i \end{array} \right] + \left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ \frac{1}{L} \end{array} \right] V(t)
% $$
%
% We choose the current as ouput as follows:
%
% $$
% y = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1 \end{array} \right] \left[ \begin{array}{c} q \\ i \end{array} \right]
% $$
%
% The transfer function representation may be found by taking the Laplace 
% transform as we did for the mass-spring-damper or from the state-space equation as follows:
%
% $$
% \frac{I(s)}{V(s)} = \mathbf{C}(s
% \mathbf{I}-\mathbf{A})^{-1}\mathbf{B}+\mathbf{D}
% = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1 \end{array} \right]
% \left( s \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{array} \right] - \left[
% \begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1 \\ -\frac{1}{LC} & -\frac{R}{L} \end{array} \right] \right)^{-1} \left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ \frac{1}{L} \end{array} \right]
% $$
%
% $$
% \frac{I(s)}{V(s)} = \frac{s}{Ls^2+Rs+\frac{1}{C}}
% $$
%
% The RLC state-space and transfer fcuntion models can be entered into
% MATLAB using the same procedure as discussed for the mass-spring-damper
% system above.

%% System Identification
%
% In this section, we have seen how to model systems using basic physical
% principles; however, often this is not possible either 
% because the parameters of the system are uncertain, or 
% the underlying processes are simply not known.  In 
% these cases, we must rely on experimental measurements and statistical 
% techniques to develop a system model, a process known as system identification.   
%
% System identification may be performed using either time-domain or
% frequency-domain data, see the
% < ?aux=Extras_Identification Introduction: System Identification> page.
% 
% Also refer to MATLABâ€™s <http://www.mathworks.com/products/sysid/ System Identification Toolbox> for more information on this subject. 
% 
%% System Conversions
%
% Most operations in MATLAB can be performed on either the transfer
% function, the state-space model, or the zero-pole-gain form. Furthermore, 
% it is simple to transfer between these if the other form of representation 
% is required. If you need to learn how to convert from one representation 
% to the other, see the < ?aux=Extras_Conversions Introduction: System Conversions> page.

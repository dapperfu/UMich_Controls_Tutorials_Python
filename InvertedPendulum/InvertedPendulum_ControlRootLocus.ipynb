This means that no matter the choice of gain $K$, there will always be a closed-loop pole in the right-half plane making the system's impulse response unstable. To solve this problem, we need to add a pole at the origin (an integrator) via the controller to cancel the plant zero at the origin. This addition will produce two closed-loop poles in the right-half plane. In our subsequent design we can then modify our controller to draw these poles into the left-half plane, thereby stabilizing the closed-loop system.

This configuration is also unsatisfactory because we still have branches of the root locus that are entirely in the right-half complex plane. In general, we can pull the branches of our root locus to the left in the complex plane by adding zeros to our system. Adding a zero to our controller will reduce the number of asymptotes from three to two.  These two asymptotes will be parallel to the imaginary axis and will intersect the real axis at the location \\\\(s\\\\) calculated from the following expression.\n",

A possible solution is to add yet another zero. If we place both zeros on the negative real axis between the two plant poles, then the two branches in the right-half plane will be pulled into the left-half plane and will terminate at these two zeros. Let's specifically evaluate the root locus for a controller with an integrator and zeros at -3 and -4. Note that this controller is actually a PID controller. We can create this controller within MATLAB using the |zpk| command which creates a model by specifying the zeros, poles, and gain of the system. Modifying your m-file with the following commands and re-running will produce the root locus plot shown below."

    "Examining the above root locus helps us to determine whether or not our given requirements can be met. Specifically, since it is desired that the settling time of the system be less than 5 seconds, the real parts of our dominant closed-loop poles should be less than approximately -4/5 = -0.8. In other words, our dominatnt closed-loop poles should be located in the complex $s$-plane to the left of a vertical line at $s = -0.8$. Inspection of the above shows that this is possible. Since it is also desired that the pendulum not move more than 0.05 radians away from vertical, we also want to ensure that the closed-loop system has sufficient damping. Placing the dominant closed-loop poles near the real axis will increase the system's damping (small $\\beta$). To find the gain corresponding to a specific point on the root locus, we can use the |rlocfind| command. Specifically, enter the command |[k,poles] = rlocfind(C*P_pend)| in the MATLAB command window. Then go to the plot and select a point on the root locus on left side of the loop, close to the real axis as shown below with the small |+| marks. Selecting these poles will ensure that the system settles sufficiently fast and, hopefully, that it has sufficient damping.\n",

Then we can check the impulse response of our closed-loop system to see if our requirements are actually met for a gain \\\\(K\\\\) of approximately 20.

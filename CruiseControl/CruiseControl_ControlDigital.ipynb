    "## Discrete-time transfer function\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in performing a discrete analysis of a system is to find the discrete-time equivalent transfer function of the continuous portion.  We will convert the above transfer function (Y(s)/U(s)) to a discrete-time transfer function using the MATLAB function |c2d|.  To use this function, you need to specify three arguments: system, sampling time (Ts), and the |'method'|. You should already be familiar with how to enter num and den matrices. The sampling time (Ts), in the unit of sec/sample, should be smaller than 1/(30*BW), where BW is the closed-loop bandwidth frequency. For the method, we will use the zero-order hold (|'zoh'|). Let the sampling time equal 1/50 sec; this is sufficiently fast assuming that the bandwidth frequency is 1 rad/sec. Now enter the following commands into an [m-file](../Extras_Mfile.ipynb) and run it in the command window."

Let's generate the root-locus and use the |zgrid| command to find the acceptable region of the root-locus. But before doing that, if you refer to the [Digital Control Tutorial](../Introduction/Introduction-ControlDigital.ipynb), the natural frequency argument for |zgrid| needs to be in units of rad/sample, so let Wn = 0.36*Ts = 0.0072 rad/sample.

The other dotted line indicates the locations of constant damping ratio (zeta), and the damping ratio is greater than 0.6 inside the line. The jagged vertical line is a portion of the unit circle which is calculated at low resolution (hence the jaggedness). In the above plot, you can see that part of the root locus is inside the desired region.

Running the command |[K,poles] = rlocfind(dP_cruise)| in the MATLAB command window will generate a prompt directing you to select a point on the root locus. Remember that if you choose a pole which is too far inside the unit circle, then the step response will be too fast indicating a physically unreasonable acceleration. Therefore, you should choose the pole which is near the intersection of the constant natural frequency and the real axis. Select the point near 0.99 as shown by the cross mark on the following root locus graph.\n",

The discrete design method described says that the zero of the lag compensator should be chosen to (approximately) cancel one of the plant poles, as long as it is stable. Thus, we choose the zero to be at zo = 0.999. To reduce the steady-state error, we note that the low frequency gain of the discrete-time control system with a lag compensator is increased by a factor of (1 - zo)/(1 - po). To reduce the steady-state error by a factor of 5, we choose po = 0.9998. To have a gain of 1 at zero frequency, the numerator is multiplied by Kd = (1 - zp)/(1 - zo) = 0.2 before using the root locus. Note that the whole compensator is multiplied by the loop gain determined from the root locus. Now we have the discrete-time compensator transfer function. Let's generate the root-locus and obtain the step response. First create a new m-file and enter the following commands."

    "Automatic **cruise control** is an excellent example of a feedback control system found in many modern vehicles. The purpose of the cruise control system is to maintain a constant vehicle speed despite external **disturbances**, such as changes in wind or road grade. This is accomplished by measuring the vehicle speed, comparing it to the desired or **reference** speed, and automatically adjusting the throttle according to a **control law**.\n",
    "![cruise_control_schematic.png](figures/cruise_control_schematic.png)\n",
    "We consider here a simple model of the vehicle dynamics, shown in the free-body diagram (FBD) above.  The vehicle, of mass m, is acted on by a control force, u. The force u represents the force generated at the road/tire interface. For this simplified model we will assume that we can control this force directly and will neglect the dynamics of the powertrain, tires, etc., that go into generating the force. The resistive forces, bv, due to rolling resistance and wind drag, are assumed to vary linearly with the vehicle velocity, v, and act in the direction opposite the vehicle's motion.\n",

The variables in the |sgrid| command are the damping ratio (_zeta_ = 0.5) and the natural frequency (_Wn_ = 0). The variable in the |sigrid| command is the _sigma_ term. The _zeta_ and _sigma_ used above correspond to an overshoot of 16% and a settling time of 0.040 seconds, respectively, for a canonical second-order system. Even though our motor transfer function is third order, it will be explained that these second-order based definitions will work well. No value is given for _Wn_ since we have no requirement on rise time. From the above figure, the two open-loop poles near the origin cannot be distinguished because the scale of the axes is set to show the third pole which is much farther to the left than the other two poles. The MATLAB command |pole| can be employed to determine the exact values of the open-loop poles."

Therefore, if you have a transfer function which has one (or more) poles much farther to the left in the complex plane (more negative) than the other poles, their effect on the dynamic response will be hidden by the slower, more dominant poles. In the case of our motor position example, the transient closed-loop response for small gains will not be affected much by the open-loop pole at -1.45e6.

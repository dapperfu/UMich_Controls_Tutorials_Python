    "# Introduction: Frequency Domain Methods for Controller Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The frequency response method of controller design may be less intuitive than other methods you have studied previously.  However, it has certain advantages, especially in real-life situations such as modeling transfer functions from physical data.  In this tutorial, we will see how we can use the open-loop frequency response of a system to predict its behavior in closed-loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gain and Phase Margin\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following unity feedback system:\n",
    "![FrequencyResponseTutorial_BodePlots_Margins_BlockDiagram.png](figures/FrequencyResponseTutorial_BodePlots_Margins_BlockDiagram.png)\n",
    "where \\\\(K\\\\) is a variable (constant) gain and \\\\(G(s)\\\\) is the plant under consideration.  The **gain margin** is defined as the change in open-loop gain required to make the system unstable.  Systems with greater gain margins can withstand greater changes in system parameters before becoming unstable in closed-loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **phase margin** is defined as the change in open-loop phase shift required to make a closed-loop system unstable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The phase margin also measures the system's tolerance to time delay.  If there is a time delay greater than \\\\(180/W_{pc}\\\\) in the loop (where \\\\(W_{pc}\\\\) is the frequency where the phase shift is 180 deg), the system will become unstable in closed-loop.  The time delay, \\\\(\\tau_d\\\\) can be thought of as an extra block in the forward path of the block diagram that adds phase to the system but has no effect on the gain.  That is, a time delay can be represented as a block with magnitude of 1 and phase \\\\(\\omega \\tau_d\\\\) (in radians/second).\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we won't worry about where all this comes from and will concentrate on identifying the gain and phase margins on a Bode plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The phase margin is the difference in phase between the phase curve and -180 degrees at the point corresponding to the frequency that gives us a gain of 0 dB (the gain crossover frequency, $W_{gc}$).  Likewise, the gain margin is the difference between the magnitude curve and 0 dB at the point corresponding to the frequency that gives us a phase of -180 degrees (the phase crossover frequency, $W_{pc}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "![FrequencyResponseTutorial_BodePlots_Margins_MarginDiagrams.png](figures/FrequencyResponseTutorial_BodePlots_Margins_MarginDiagrams.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "One nice thing about the phase margin is that you don't need to replot the Bode in order to find the new phase margin when changing the gains. If you recall, adding gain only shifts the magnitude plot up.  This is equivalent to changing the y-axis on the magnitude plot.  Finding the phase margin is simply a matter of finding the new cross-over frequency and reading off the phase margin.  For example, suppose you entered the command ```bode(sys)```. You will get the following bode plot:"

However, when we design via frequency response, we are interested in predicting the closed-loop behavior from the open-loop response.  Therefore, we will use a second-order system approximation and say that the bandwidth frequency equals the frequency at which the open-loop magnitude response is between -6 and -7.5 dB, assuming the open-loop phase response is between -135 deg and -225 deg.  For a complete derivation of this approximation, consult your textbook.\n",

    "Since this is the closed-loop transfer function, our bandwidth frequency will be the frequency corresponding to a gain of -3 dB.  Looking at the plot, we find that it is approximately 1.4 rad/s.  We can also read off the plot that for an input frequency of 0.3 radians, the output sinusoid should have a magnitude about one and the phase should be shifted by perhaps a few degrees (behind the input).  For an input frequency of 3 rad/sec, the output magnitude should be about -20 dB (or 1/10 as large as the input) and the phase should be nearly -180 (almost exactly out-of-phase).  We can use the ```lsim``` command to simulate the response of the system to sinusoidal inputs. \n",

The Nyquist criterion can be used for design purposes regardless of open-loop stability (remember that the Bode design methods assume that the system is stable in open-loop).  Therefore, we use this criterion to determine closed-loop stability when the Bode plots display confusing information. \n",

    "The Nyquist diagram is basically a plot of \\\\(G(j\\omega)\\\\) where \\\\(G(s)\\\\) is the open-loop transfer function and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a vector of frequencies which encloses the entire right-half plane.  In drawing the Nyquist diagram, both positive and negative frequencies (from zero to infinity) are taken into account.  We will represent positive frequencies in red and negative frequencies in green.  The frequency vector used in plotting the Nyquist diagram usually looks like this (if you can imagine the plot stretching out to infinity):\n",

    "The Cauchy criterion (from complex analysis) states that when taking a closed contour in the complex plane, and mapping it through a complex function \\\\(G(s)\\\\), the number of times that the plot of \\\\(G(s)\\\\) encircles the origin is equal to the number of zeros of \\\\(G(s)\\\\) enclosed by the frequency contour minus the number of poles of \\\\(G(s)\\\\) enclosed by the frequency contour.  Encirclements of the origin are counted as positive if they are in the same direction as the original closed contour or negative if they are in the opposite direction. When studying feedback controls, we are not as interested in \\\\(G(s)\\\\) as in the closed-loop transfer function:\n",

Since we are interested in the closed-loop stability, we want to know if there are any closed-loop poles (zeros of \\\\(1 + G(s)\\\\)) in the right-half plane.  More details on how to determine this will come later. Therefore, the behavior of the Nyquist diagram around the -1 point in the real axis is very important; however, the axis on the standard ```nyquist``` diagram might make it hard to see what's happening around this point. To view a simple Nyquist plot, we will define the following transfer function and view the Nyquist plot:\n",

    "There are several characteristics of the system that can be read directly from this Bode plot.  First of all, we can see that the bandwidth frequency is around 10 rad/sec.  Since the bandwidth frequency is roughly the same as the natural frequency (for a first order system of this type), the rise time is |1.8/BW = 1.8/10 = 1.8 seconds|.  This is a rough estimate, so we will say the rise time is about 2 seconds. The phase margin for this system is approximately 95 degrees.  The relation |damping ratio = PM/100| only holds for |PM < 60|.  Since the system is first-order, there should be no overshoot. The last major point of interest is **steady-state error**. The steady-state error can be read directly off the Bode plot as well.  The constant ($K_p$, $K_v$, or $K_a$) is found from the intersection of the low frequency asymptote with the |w = 1| line.  Just extend the low frequency line to the |w = 1| line.  The magnitude at this point is the constant. Since the Bode plot of this system is a horizontal line at low frequencies (slope = 0), we know this system is of type zero.  Therefore, the intersection is easy to find.  The gain is 20 dB (magnitude 10). What this means is that the constant for the error function is 10.  The steady-state error is |1/(1+Kp) = 1/(1+10) = 0.091|. If our system was type one instead of type zero, the constant for the steady-state error would be found in a manner similar to the following.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "G_c(s) = \\frac{K(s + a)}{s}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we need to find is the damping ratio corresponding to a percent overshoot of 40%.  Plugging in this value into the equation relating overshoot and damping ratio (or consulting a plot of this relation), we find that the damping ratio corresponding to this overshoot is approximately 0.28.  Therefore, our phase margin should be at least 30 degrees. We must have a bandwidth frequency greater than or equal to 12 if we want our settling time to be less than 1.75 seconds which meets the design specs. Now that we know our desired phase margin and bandwidth frequency, we can start our design.  Remember that we are looking at the open-loop Bode plots.  Therefore, our bandwidth frequency will be the frequency corresponding to a gain of approximately -7 dB. Let's see how the integrator portion of the PI or affects our response. Change your |m-file| to look like the following (this adds an integral term but no proportional term):"

Keeping careful track of open- and closed-loop transfer functions, as well as numerators and denominators, you should convince yourself that:\n",
    "* The zeros of |1 + G(s)H(s)| are the poles of the closed-loop transfer function.\n",
    "* The poles of |1 + G(s)H(s)| are the poles of the open-loop transfer function. The Nyquist criterion then states that:\n",
    "* |P| = the number of open-loop (unstable) poles of |G(s)H(s)|.\n",
    "* |N| = the number of times the Nyquist diagram encircles -1.\n",

    "* counter-clockwise encirclements of -1 count as negative encirclements.\n",
    "* |Z| = the number of right-half-plane (positive, real) poles of the closed-loop system. The important equation whih relates these three quantities is:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "Z = P + N\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: This is only one convention for the Nyquist criterion. Another convention states that a positive |N| counts the counter-clockwise or anti-clockwise encirclements of -1.  The |P| and |Z| variables remain the same.  In this case the equation becomes |Z = P - N|.  Throughout these tutorials, we will use a positive sign for clockwise encirclements.* It is very important (and somewhat tricky) to learn how to count the number of times that the diagram encircles -1.  Therefore, we will go into some detail to help you visualize this.  You can view this **movie** as an example. Another way of looking at it is to imagine you are standing on top of the -1 point and are following the diagram from beginning to end.  Now ask yourself: How many times did I turn my head a full 360 degrees?  Again, if the motion was clockwise, |N| is positive, and if the motion is anti-clockwise, |N| is negative. Knowing the number of right-half plane (unstable) poles in open loop (|P|), and the number of encirclements of -1 made by the Nyquist diagram (|N|), we can determine the closed-loop stability of the system.  If |Z = P + N| is a positive, nonzero number, the closed-loop system is unstable. We can also use the Nyquist diagram to find the range of gains for a closed-loop unity feedback system to be stable.  The system we will test looks like this:\n",

However, we will see that we can only vary this gain within certain limits, since we have to make sure that our closed-loop system will be stable.  This is what we will be looking for: the range of gains that will make this system stable in the closed-loop.

We can verify our answers by zooming in on the Nyquist plots as well as by looking at the closed-loop steps responses for gains of 0.79, 0.80, and 0.81. **Gain Margin** We already defined the gain margin as the change in open-loop gain expressed in decibels (dB), required at 180 degrees of phase shift to make the system unstable.

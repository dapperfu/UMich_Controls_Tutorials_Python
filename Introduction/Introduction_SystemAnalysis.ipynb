    "# Introduction: System Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Once appropriate mathematical models of a system have been obtained, either in state-space or transfer function form, we may then analyze these models to predict how the system will respond in both the time and frequency domains.  To put this in context, control systems are often designed to improve stability, speed of response, steady-state error, or prevent oscillations. In this section, we will show how to determine these dynamic properties from the system models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Response Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The **time response** represents how the state of a dynamic system changes in time when subjected to a particular input.  Since the models we have derived consist of differential equations, some integration must be performed in order to determine the time response of the system.  For some simple systems, a closed-form analytical solution may be available.  However, for most systems, especially nonlinear systems or those subject to complicated input forces, this integration must be carried out numerically.  Fortunately, MATLAB provides many useful resources for calculating time responses for many types of inputs, as we shall see in the following sections. The time response of a linear dynamic system consists of the sum of the **transient response** which depends on the initial conditions and the **steady-state response** which depends on the system input.  These correspond to the free (homogeneous or zero input) and the forced (inhomogeneous or non-zero input) solutions of the governing differential equations respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Frequency Response Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "All the examples presented in this tutorial are modeled by linear constant coefficient differential equations and are thus linear time-invariant (LTI). LTI systems have the extremely important property that if the input to the system is sinusoidal, then the steady-state output will also be sinusoidal at the same frequency but in general with different magnitude and phase. These magnitude and phase differences as a function of frequency comprise the **frequency response** of the system. The frequency response of a system can be found from the transfer function in the following way: create a vector of frequencies (varying between zero or \"DC\" to infinity) and compute the value of the plant transfer function at those frequencies. If \\\\(G(s)\\\\) is the open-loop transfer function of a system and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is the frequency vector, we then plot \\\\(G(j\\omega)\\\\) versus $\\omega$. Since \\\\(G(j\\omega)\\\\) is a complex number, we can plot both its magnitude and phase (the **Bode Plot**) or its position in the complex plane (the **Nyquist Diagram**). Both methods display the same information in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stability\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, we will use the *Bounded Input Bounded Output (BIBO)* definition of stability which states that a system is stable if the output remains bounded for all bounded (finite) inputs.  Practically, this means that the system will not “blow up” while in operation. The transfer function representation is especially useful when analyzing system stability.  If all poles of the transfer function (values of s at which the denominator equals zero) have negative real parts, then the system is stable.  If any pole has a positive real part, then the system is unstable.  If we view the poles on the complex s-plane, then all poles must be in the left half plane (LHP) to ensure stability.  If any pair of poles is on the imaginary axis, then the system is marginally stable and the system will oscillate. The poles of a LTI system model can easily be found in MATLAB using the |pole| command, an example if which is shown below:"

For first order systems equal to $k_{dc} = b/a$. **Time Constant** The time constant \\\\(T_c = \\tau = 1/a\\\\) is the time it takes for the system to reach 63% of the steady-state value for a step response or to decrease to 37 of the inital value for an impulse response.  More generally, it represents the time scale for which the dynamics of the system are significant. *Poles/Zeros* There is a single real pole at $s=-a$.  Therefore, the system is stable if \\\\(a\\\\) is positive and unstable if \\\\(a\\\\) is negative.

The settling times for first order system for the most common tolerances are provided in the table below. Note that the tighter the tolerance, the longer the system response takes to settle to within this tolerance, as expected. <html> <table style=\"border:2px solid black;\" align=\"center\" > <tr style=\"background-color:#EEEEEE; font-weight:bold;\"><td>10%</td><td>5%</td><td>2%</td><td>1%</td></tr> <tr><td>Ts=2.3/a=2.3Tc</td><td>Ts=3/a=3Tc</td><td>Ts=3.9/a=3.9Tc</td><td>Ts=4.6/a=4.6Tc</td></tr> </table> </html> **Rise Time** The rise time, $T_r$, is the time required for the system output to rise from some lower level x% to some higher level y% of the final steady-state value.

Using the dB scale, we may simply add the magnitudes of the transfer functions. Note, we may also add the phase angles though these are not shown on a log scale. The low frequency magnitude of the first order bode plot is $20\\log(k_{dc})$. The magnitude plot has a bend at the frequency equal to the absolute value of the pole (ie. $\\omega = a$), and then decreases at 20dB for every factor of ten increase in frequency (-20dB/decade).  The phase plot is asymptotic to 0 degrees at low frequency, and asymptotic to -90 degrees at high frequency. Between frequency 0.1a and 10a, the phase changes by approximately -45 degrees for every factor of ten increase in frequency (-45 degrees/decade).

    "## Dynamic Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic systems** are systems that change or evolve in time according to a fixed rule. For many physical systems, this rule can be stated as a set of first-order differential equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dt} = \\mathbf{f}\\left( \\mathbf{x}(t), \\mathbf{u}(t), t \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above equation, $\\mathbf{x}(t)$ is the **state vector**, a set of variables representing the configuration of the system at time $t$. For instance in a simple mechanical mass-spring-damper system, the two state variables could be the position and velocity of the mass. $\\mathbf{u}(t)$ is the vector of control inputs at time $t$, representing the externally applied \"forces\" on the system, and $\\mathbf{f}$ is a possibly nonlinear function giving the time derivative (rate of change) of the state vector, $d\\mathbf{x}/dt$ for a particular state, input, and time. The state at any future time, $\\mathbf{x}(t_1)$, may be determined exactly given knowledge of the initial state, $\\mathbf{x}(t_0)$, and the time history of the inputs, $\\mathbf{u}(t)$, between $t_0$ and $t_1$ by integrating Eq.(1). Though the state variables themselves are not unique, there is a minimum number of state variables, $n$, required in a given system for the above to hold true. $n$ is referred to as the **system order** and determines the dimensionality of the **state-space**. The system order usually corresponds to the number of independent energy storage elements in the system. The relationship given in Eq.(1) is very general and can be used to describe a wide variety of different systems; unfortunately, it may be very difficult to analyze. There are two common simplifications which make the problem more tractable. First, if the function, $\\mathbf{f}$, does not depend explicitly on time, i.e. $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{u})$, then the system is said to be **time invariant**. This is often a very reasonable assumption, since the underlying physical laws themselves do not typically depend on time. For time invariant systems, the parameters or coefficients of the function, $\\mathbf{f}$, are constant. The control input, however, may still be time dependent, $\\mathbf{u}(t)$. The second common assumption concerns the linearity of the system. In reality, nearly every physical system is nonlinear. In other words, $\\mathbf{f}$ is typically some complicated function of the state and inputs. These nonlinearities arise in many different ways, one of the most common in control systems being \"saturation\" in which an element of the system reaches a hard physical limit to its operation. Fortunately, over a sufficiently small operating range (think tangent line near a curve), the dynamics of most systems are approximately **linear**, that is $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{Ax} + \\mathbf{Bu}$. Until the advent of digital computers (and to a large extent thereafter), it was only practical to analyze *linear time invariant (LTI)* systems. Consequently, most of the results of control theory are based on these assumptions. Fortunately, as we shall see, these results have proven to be remarkably effective and many significant engineering challenges have been solved using LTI techniques. In fact, the true power of feedback control systems are that they work (are **robust**) in the presence of the unavoidable modeling uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "## State-Space Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "For continuous linear time invariant (LTI) systems, the standard state-space representation is given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{Ax} + \\mathbf{Bu}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{Cx} + \\mathbf{Du}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{x}$ is the vector of state variables (nx1), $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}$ is the time derivative of state vector (nx1), $\\mathbf{u}$ is the input or control vector (px1), $\\mathbf{y}$ is the output vector (qx1), $\\mathbf{A}$ is the system matrix (nxn), $\\mathbf{B}$ is the input matrix (nxp), $\\mathbf{C}$ is the output matrix (qxn), $\\mathbf{D}$ is the feedforward matrix (qxp). The output equation, Eq.(3), is necessary because often there are state variables which are not directly observed or are otherwise not of interest.  The output matrix, $\\mathbf{C}$, is used to specify which state variables (or combinations thereof) are available for use by the controller. Also often there is no direct feedforward in which case $\\mathbf{D}$ is the zero matrix. The state-space representation, also referred to as the time-domain representation, can easily handle *multi-input/multi-output (MIMO)* systems, systems with non-zero initial conditions, and nonlinear systems via Eq.(1). Consequently, the state-space representation is used extensively in \"modern\" control theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transfer Function Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "LTI systems have the extremely important property that if the input to the system is sinusoidal, then the output will also be sinusoidal at the same frequency but in general with different magnitude and phase. These magnitude and phase differences as a function of frequency are known as the **frequency response** of the system. Using the **Laplace transform**, it is possible to convert a system's time-domain representation into a frequency-domain output/input representation, known as the **transfer function**.  In so doing, it also transforms the governing differential equation into an algebraic equation which is often easier to analyze. The Laplace transform of a time domain function, $f(t)$, is defined below:\n",

    "where the parameter $s=\\sigma+j\\omega$ is a complex frequency variable. It is very rare in practice that you will have to directly evaluate a Laplace transform (though you should certainly know how).

    "## Physical setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Designing an automotive suspension system is an interesting and challenging control problem. When the suspension system is designed, a 1/4 model (one of the four wheels) is used to simplify the problem to a 1D multiple spring-damper system. A diagram of this system is shown below.\n",
    "![susp1.png](figures/susp1.png)\n",
    "The system parameters are as follows. (m1)    body mass                                2500 kg (m2)    suspension mass                          320 kg (k1)    spring constant of suspension system     80,000 N/m (k2)    spring constant of wheel and tire        500,000 N/m (b1)    damping constant of suspension system    350 N.s/m (b2)    damping constant of wheel and tire       15,020 N.s/m (u)     control force = force from the controller we are going to design\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "A good automotive suspension system should have satisfactory road holding ability, while still providing comfort when riding over bumps and holes in the road. When the vehicle is experiencing any road disturbance (i.e. pot holes, cracks, and uneven pavement),the vehicle body should not have large oscillations, and the oscillations should dissipate quickly. Since the distance X1-W is very difficult to measure, and the deformation of the tire (X2-W) is negligible, we will use the distance X1-X2 instead of X1-W as the output in our problem. Keep in mind that this is an estimation. The road disturbance (W) in this problem will be simulated by a step input. This step could represent the vehicle coming out of a pothole. We want to design a feedback controller so that the output (X1-X2) has an overshoot less than 5% and a settling time shorter than 5 seconds. For example, when the vehicle runs onto a 10 cm high step, the vehicle body will oscillate within a range of +/- 5 mm and return to a smooth ride within 5 seconds.\n",

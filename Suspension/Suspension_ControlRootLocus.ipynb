For example, when the bus runs onto a 10 cm high step, the bus body will oscillate within a range of +/- 5 mm and will stop oscillating within 5 seconds. The system model can be represented in MATLAB by creating a new [m-file](../Extras_Mfile.ipynb) and entering the following commands (refer to the main problem for the details of getting those commands)."

The command |sgrid| is used to overlay the desired percent overshoot line on the close-up root locus; you can find more information from commands list. From the plot above, we see that there are two pair of poles and zeros that are very close together. These poles and zeros are almost on the imaginary axis, they might make the bus system marginally stable, which might cause a problem. We have to make all of the poles and zeros move into the left-half plane as far as possible to avoid an unstable system. We have to put two zeros very close to the two poles on the imaginary axis of uncompensated system for pole-and-zero cancellation. Moreover, we will put another two poles further to the left on the real axis to get fast response.\n",

    "## Finding the gain from the root locus\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have moved the root locus across the 5% damping ratio line, we can choose a gain that will satisfy the design requirements. Recall that we want the settling time and the overshoot to be as small as possible. Generally, to get a small overshoot and a fast response, we need to select a gain corresponding to a point on the root locus near the real axis and far from the imaginary axis or the point that the root locus crosses the desired damping ratio line. But in this case, we need the cancellation of poles and zeros near the imaginary axis, so we need to select a gain corresponding to a point on the root locus near the zeros and percent overshoot line. There is a method to do this with the |rlocfind| command in MATLAB. Add the code |[k,poles]=rlocfind(C*G1)| onto the end of your m-file to help you choose a specific loop gain. After running in the command window, go to the root locus plot and select a point near those indicated by the cross marks on the plot below.\n",

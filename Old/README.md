# Control Tutorials for Python

## Licenses

I'm an engineer, not a lawyer. Hopefully this covers everything I've made. Not exactly sure where the 'creative contents' overlaps with 'source code' but here's my half attempt at covering all bases:

## Acknowledgements

- A big thanks to the original authors of the controls work: http://ctms.engin.umich.edu/CTMS/index.php?aux=Home

> These tutorials were originally developed by [Prof. Bill Messner](https://www.cmu.edu/me/people/william-c-messner.html) at [Carnegie Mellon](http://www.cmu.edu/) and [Prof. Dawn Tilbury](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~tilbury/) at the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/). Originally funded by NSF with further funding by MathWorks in 2011, Prof. Messner, [Assoc. Prof. Rick Hill](https://www.udmercy.edu/about/meet_faculty/ces/Rick-Hill.htm) (U Detroit-Mercy), and PhD Student JD Taylor (CMU), completely redesigned the web interface and updated all of the tutorials to reflect new functionality and tools available in the most recent version of the software (MATLAB R2012a). Additional funding by the MathWorks in 2014 allowed for the addition of the hardware-based activities that can be accessed under the Resources tab at the top of this window. Most of the original development work was done by undergraduate students Luis Oms (CMU), Joshua Pagel (UM), Yanjie Sun (UM), and Munish Suri (CMU) over the summer of 1996 and Christopher Caruana (UM), Dai Kawano (UM), Brian Nakai (CMU) and Pradya Prempraneerach (CMU) over the summer of 1997. Graduate student Jonathon Luntz (CMU) wrote the Simulink tutorials and contributed significantly in preparing the tutorials for web publication.

> A prototype set of tutorials, developed by Prof. Tilbury, won an Undergraduate Computational Science Award from the U.S. Department of Energy, and the first set of Control Tutorials for MATLAB won the Educom Medal. 

- Another big thanks to [Prof. Barba's](http://lorenabarba.com/) [AeroPython](https://github.com/barbagroup/AeroPython) for serving as an inspiration to Pythonize my undergradute ME degree.

With out their work I can absolutely say that this would not have been possible (or started).

While Python can get by in this area for most things, after doing a lot of these examples I still much prefer MATLAB for daily work. Especially since there is no replacement for Simulink **at this time** [*Hint-hint-hint* to any coders out there that are looking for an niche market that needs filled].

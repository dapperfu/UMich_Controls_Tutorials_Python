Since the steady-state error approaches zero in a sufficiently fast manner, no additional integral action is needed. You can set the integral gain constant \\\\(K_i\\\\) to zero to see for yourself that some integral control is needed. The peak response, however, is larger than the requirement of 0.05 radians. Recall that overshoot often can be reduced by increasing the amount of derivative control.

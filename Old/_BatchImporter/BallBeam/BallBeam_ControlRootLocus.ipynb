By adding zeroes and/or poles to the original system (adding a compensator), the root locus and thus the closed-loop response will be modified. Let us first view the root locus for the plant in open loop. Create a new [m-file](../Extras_Mfile.ipynb) with the following MATLAB code in order to model the plant and plot the root locus. Now, run the m-file and you should see the following root locus plot:"

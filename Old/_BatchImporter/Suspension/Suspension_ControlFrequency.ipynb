For example, when the bus runs onto a 10 cm high step, the bus body will oscillate within a range of +/- 5 mm and will stop oscillating within 5 seconds. The system model can be represented in MATLAB by creating a new [m-file](../Extras_Mfile.ipynb) and entering the following commands (refer to the main problem for the details of getting those commands)."

    "For convenience in representing systems with different natural frequencies of the system, we normalize and scale our findings before plotting the Bode plot, so that the low-frequency asymptote of each term is at 0 dB. This normalization by adjusting the gain, K, makes it easier to add the components of the Bode plot. The effect of K is to move the magnitude curve up (increasing K) or down (decreasing K) by an amount 20*logK, but the gain, K, has no effect on the phase curve. Therefore from the previous plot, K must be equal to 100 dB or 100,000 to move the magnitude curve up to 0 dB at 0.1 rad/s. Go back to your m-file and add the following line of code to your m-file before the |bode| command and rerun. You should get the following Bode plot:"

First, we will try to add positive phase around this region, so that the phase will remain above the -180 degree line. Since a large phase margin leads to a small overshoot, we will want to add at least 140 degrees of positive phase at the area near 5 rad/sec. Since one lead controller can add no more than +90 degrees, we will use a two-lead controller. To obtain T and a, the following steps can be used: *1. Determine the positive phase needed:* Since we want 140 degrees total, we will need 70 degrees from each controller. *2. Determine the frequency where the phase should be added:* In our case this frequency should be 5.0 rad/sec. *3.

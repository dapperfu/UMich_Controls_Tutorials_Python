We will use the model from above. The first thing that we need to do is to identify the inputs and outputs of the model we wish to extract. First right-click on the signal representing the Voltage input in the Simulink model. Then choose *Linearization > Input Point* from the resulting menu. Similarly, right-click on the signal representing the Position output and select *Linearization > Output Point* from the resulting menu.

To further verify the validity of the model extraction, we will generate an open-loop step response of the discrete-time transfer function in MATLAB. Enter the following commands at the prompt of the MATLAB command window.

Edit the Zero Order Hold blocks such that the **Sample time** fields are set to \"0.001\" (this is fast compared to the desired step response in the MATLAB tutorial). Next edit the Discrete Zero Pole block to model the discrete controller transfer function described above. Specifically, edit the **Zeros** field to \"[0.95 0.80 0.80]\", the **Poles** field to \"[-0.98 0.6 1]\", the **Gain** field to \"800\", and the **Sample time** field to \"0.001\". Then label the block \"Controller\" and resize it to view its entire contents. Next, enter \"|+-\" to the **List of signs** field of the Sum block.

    "In the above, we extracted a linear sampled model of our plant from our Simulink model into the MATLAB workspace using the **Linear Analysis Tool**. We also, in effect, discretized the plant for the purposes of simulation using Zero Order Hold blocks within Simulink. In this section, we will generate a discrete-time model of our plant without the use of the Zero Order Hold blocks. This approach offers a wider array of discretization techniques than can be achieved through Simulink blocks, which are limited to Zero Order and First Order Hold. This is especially useful in generating a digital controller from a continous design. So far we have chosen to employ the first principles simulink model but we could have just as easily used the Simscape model or the LTI System model. One thing to be careful of, however, is that if you were to use the Simscape model of the plant in the above, the physical Simscape signals would need to be converted to dimensionless Simulink signals in order to interface with the Simulink blocks we employed. This process is described in the [DC Motor Position: Simulink Modeling](../MotorPosition/MotorPosition-SimulinkModeling.ipynb) page. In the following, we will discretize the LTI System model which can be downloaded here, <Content/MotorPosition/Simulink/Control/Motor_Pos_LTI.mdl Motor_Pos_LTI.mdl>, or you can create it yourself as [DC Motor Position: Simulink Modeling](../MotorPosition/MotorPosition-SimulinkModeling.ipynb)  page. Recall that the LTI System block imports a model from the MATLAB workspace. Therefore, you need to enter the following commands at the command line where it is presumed that values have already been entered for the various physical parameters."

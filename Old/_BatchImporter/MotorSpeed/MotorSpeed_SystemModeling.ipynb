    "A common actuator in control systems is the DC motor. It directly provides rotary motion and, coupled with wheels or drums and cables, can provide translational motion. The electric equivalent circuit of the armature and the free-body diagram of the rotor are shown in the following figure.\n",

    "For this example, we will assume that the input of the system is the voltage source (_V_) applied to the motor's armature, while the output is the rotational speed of the shaft d(_theta_)/dt. The rotor and shaft are assumed to be rigid. We further assume a viscous friction model, that is, the friction torque is proportional to shaft angular velocity. The physical parameters for our example are: (J)     moment of inertia of the rotor     0.01 kg.m^2 (b)     motor viscous friction constant    0.1 N.m.s (Ke)    electromotive force constant       0.01 V/rad/sec (Kt)    motor torque constant              0.01 N.m/Amp (R)     electric resistance                1 Ohm (L)     electric inductance                0.5 H\n",

Since the most basic requirement of a motor is that it should rotate at the desired speed, we will require that the steady-state error of the motor speed be less than 1%. Another performance requirement for our motor is that it must accelerate to its steady-state speed as soon as it turns on. In this case, we want it to have a settling time less than 2 seconds. Also, since a speed faster than the reference may damage the equipment, we want to have a step response with overshoot of less than 5%. In summary, for a unit step command in motor speed, the control system's output should meet the following requirements.\n",

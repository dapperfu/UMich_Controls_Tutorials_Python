Within the **Linear Analysis Tool** window, the **Operating Point** to be linearized about can remain the default, |Model Initial Condition|. In order to perform the linearization, next click the **Linearize** button identified by the green triangle. The result of this linearization is the |linsys1| object which now appears in the **Linear Analysis Workspace** as shown below. Furthermore, the open-loop step response of the linearized system was also generated automatically.\n",

    "The open-loop step response above is consistent with the response generated in the [DC Motor Speed: System Analysis](../MotorSpeed/MotorSpeed-SystemAnalysis.ipynb) page The reason the responses match so closely is because this Simulink model uses only linear components. Note that this process can be used extract linear approximations of models with nonlinear elements too. We will further verify the model extraction by looking at the model itself. The linearized model can be exported by simply dragging the object into the **MATLAB Workspace**. This object can then be used within MATLAB in the same manner as an object created directly from the MATLAB command line. Specifically, entering the command |zpk(linsys1)| in the MATLAB command window demonstrates that the resulting model has the following form.\n",

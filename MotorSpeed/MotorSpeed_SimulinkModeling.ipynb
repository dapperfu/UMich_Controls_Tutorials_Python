    "A common actuator in control systems is the DC motor. It directly provides rotary motion and, coupled with wheels or drums and cables, can provide translational motion. The electric circuit of the armature and the free-body diagram of the rotor are shown in the following figure:\n",
    "![motor.png](figures/motor.png)\n",
    "For this example, we will assume that the input of the system is the voltage source (_V_) applied to the motor's armature, while the output is the rotational speed of the shaft d(_theta_)/dt. The rotor and shaft are assumed to be rigid. We further assume a viscous friction model, that is, the friction torque is proportional to shaft angular velocity. The physical parameters for our example are: (J)     moment of inertia of the rotor     0.01 kg.m^2 (b)     motor viscous friction constant    0.1 N.m.s (Ke)    electromotive force constant       0.01 V/rad/sec (Kt)    motor torque constant              0.01 N.m/Amp (R)     electric resistance                1 Ohm (L)     electric inductance                0.5 H In general, the torque generated by a DC motor is proportional to the armature current and the strength of the magnetic field. In this example we will assume that the magnetic field is constant and, therefore, that the motor torque is proportional to only the armature current _i_ by a constant factor _Kt_ as shown in the equation below. This is referred to as an armature-controlled motor.\n",

    "In this section, we alternatively show how to build the DC Motor model using the physical modeling blocks of the Simscape extension to Simulink. The blocks in the Simscape library represent actual physical components; therefore, complex multi-domain models can be built without the need to build mathematical equations from physical principles as was done above by applying Newton's laws and Kirchoff's laws. Open a new Simulink model and insert the following blocks to represent the electrical and mechanical elements of the DC motor.\n",

Connect and label the components as shown in the following figure. You can rotate a block in a similar manner to the way you flipped blocks, that is, by right-clicking on the block then selecting **Rotate Block** from the **Format** menu.\n",
    "![Picture6.png](figures/Picture6.png)\n",
    "Complete the design of the DC motor Simscape model by assigning values to the physical parameters of each of the blocks to match our assumed values. To assign the necessary values, double-click on the Resistor, Inductor, Inertia, Rotational Damper, and Rotational Electromechanical Converter blocks and enter the following parameters and associated units: Resistance                   = R [Ohm] Inductance                   = L [H] Inertia                      = J [kg*m^2] Constant of Proportionality  = K [V/(rad/s)] Damping coefficient          = b [N*m/(rad/s)] The Rotational Damper block serves to model the viscous friction of the motor. This type of friction model was chosen because it is linear. In most cases real friction is more complicated than this. If you wish to employ a more complicated friction model, for instance to add Coulomb friction to the model, then you may use the Rotational Friction block from the Simscape/Foundation Library/Mechanical/Rotational Elements library. Also note that in the above you generated a DC Motor model from the individual mechanical and electrical aspects of the motor. The Simscape library also includes a DC Motor block under the Simscape/SimElectronics/Actuators library. This block is used in the [DC Motor Position: Simulink Modeling](../MotorPosition/MotorPosition-SimulinkModeling.ipynb) section. The physical parameters must now be set. Enter the following commands at the MATLAB prompt."
